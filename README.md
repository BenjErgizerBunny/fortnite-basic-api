# fortnite-basic-api
Basic Fortnite API for stats and sever status built with async/await

Inspired by other repos about Fortnite API's as:

- https://github.com/SzymonLisowiec/node-epicgames-client

- https://github.com/qlaffont/fortnite-api

Which I previously used fortnite-api but have gotten issues with unhandledrejections which causing issues in other projects. Therefore I rebuilt with focus on Async/await to resolve the issues and adding support for V2 API endpoint.
